Quiet, is a kind of precipitation.
Remove the daytime fatigue, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, to look back, in the quiet listening to the sound of the memory of the passage.

To realize the deficiency of the past, grasp now, looking forward to tomorrow, putting their faith in the future, because the precipitation and appear more clearly in the quiet the mind.
Quiet, is a kind of self-cultivation.
